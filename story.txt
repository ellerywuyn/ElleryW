Ellery is a happyy husky who likes to play with other dogs.She enjoys trail runs in particular.

Usually Ellery has lots of energy. She romps around all day long, and sometimes even gets up in the middle of the night to play some more. A few days ago, though, the fluffy husky just stayed in her bed all day. She was too tired to go for a run. 

The following morning Ellery got up to her usual routine. She drank some water, barked at the paper boy and licked her fur. She noticed the front door was open so she walked over to investigate.
