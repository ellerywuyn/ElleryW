Ellery is a happyy husky who likes to play with other dogs.She enjoys trail runs in particular.

Usually Ellery has lots of energy. She romps around all day long, and sometimes even gets up in the middle of the night to play some more. A few days ago, though, the fluffy husky just stayed in her bed all day. She was too tired to go for a run.
